## Some tips when working with GIT
- "Let's go together"
  + before run command ``git checkout``, must run ``git status``
  + run ``git log --oneline`` before ``git commit``

- when to use commit -m and commit --amend

  `` git commit -m "content comment" ``// for the first commit

  ``git commit --amend ``// for the 2nd commit onwards.

    how do you know that be the first commit?

    -> you run the command `` git log --oneline ``

- Error more many commits in a pull request:

  Practice: executing rebase 2 commits in the pull request

  `` git rebase -i HEAD ~ 2
  // read and follow the instructions in terminal
  ``

- Before pushing the code to github, remember to rebase with branch master - the latest

  stand at your branch
  `` git rebase develop ``

  + with conflict: fix conflict -> git add -A -> git rebase --continue
  + no conflict: `` git push origin name_branch``

- Missed to push an unnecessary file / folder onto the pull request

  ``
  // file
  git rm --cached file_name
  // folder
  git rm -r --cached folder
  ``

- Accidentally fixed the wrong branch comment (yaoming)

  Step 1. If you run ``git commit`` not yet, you  just git checkout to branch

  Step 2. If  you run commit command, you run  `` git reflog ``

  Select the commit you want to return `` git reset id_commit ``
  then follow the Step 1

  Also, you can learn more ``git reset``

### Happy coding !!
### Enjoy !!
