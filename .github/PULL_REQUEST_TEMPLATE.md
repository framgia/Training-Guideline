## WHAT
- Change number items `completed/total` in admin page.

## HOW
- I edit js file, inject not_vary_normal items in calculate function.

## WHY
- Because in previous version - number just depends on `normal` items. But in new version, we have `state` and `confirm_state` depends on both `normal` + `not_normal` items.
