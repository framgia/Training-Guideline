# Guideline about Project 2

## 1. Some general information
#### Execution time: 10 days

## 2. Steps to take
- Complete tasks as committed in the project requirements.
- Apply unit testing in the project. Refer to the documentation in the Unit Test module of the Python course on the S*Learn system.

## 3. Add tasks on redmine + estimate time
- Each ticket task estimate takes no more than 8 hours, in case the task is large, should break down ticket

#### The process to change the status of a ticket is as follows:
1. Created ticket on redmine before starting to work
2. Tickets must fill in Category, Target Version, Parent task, Start date, Due date, Estimated time
3. Changes status "In Progress" when receives ticket
4. Task implement done, send pull request, update link of pull request, change %DONE to 90%
5. Sent pull request to the whole team to review
6. Pull requests must be approved by the member before they can be sent to the trainer for review.
7. Pull request merged, update %DONE to 100%, status to Resolved

## 4. About pull request send review
- Attachment link ticket redmine into pull request
- Attachment evidence about layout (UI/UX) into pull request for function.
- For pull requests to write unit tests, you need to attach a picture of the run test results
- Send and track pull on the system [PRTS](https://prts.sun-asterisk.vn/)

## 5. Review project
- Review the project only when the team has completed at least 80% of the required functions.
- Ensure that the data is ready for the presentation.
- Each function will be presented by its author.
- If the team completes less than 80% of the requirements, they must contact the Trainer at least two days before the deadline to request an extension.

#### Happy coding!!!
