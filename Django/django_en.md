- Require from part 2, the attendee must create pull requests after each part
- Each pull request corresponds to a part, 1 pull request has 1 commit
- How to name:
  + The github repository name: **locallibrary**

  + Pull request title (commit content): The title of that part.

Using the Pull Request Tracking System (PRTS) to send and track the pull request review. Follow the steps below:
- Login https://prts.sun-asterisk.vn/ using account your Github
- Install according to the instructions at "User Guide" menu. This link [here](https://github.com/framgia/Training-Guideline/blob/master/WorkingProcess/prts/prts_en.pdf)
- Inform trainer to add to the box chat using review pull request.

## 5. Some notes during the tutorials phase:
- Absolutely do not wait for the merged pull request part previous to do the next part. Instead, you checkout the new branch from the previous branch and continue, later rebase and fix conflicts later if any.
- Pull request after sending the trainer, you wait for a maximum of 3 hours, if after 3 hours there is still no review, please send a message to remind the trainer.
- It is recommended to create 1 commit/pull during the tutorial.
- For the first pull request, the Chatbot will not have a notification, from the next time there will be a notification when using the PRTS system.
- In the process of doing, if you have a problem that can't be solved after research by yourself, please take the initiative to ask other friends or trainer for support

### Happy coding!!!
